# i made you a mixtape

## Description

You and your group will use everything you’ve learned over the past six modules to create a real-world front-end application that you’ll be able to showcase to potential employers. The user story and acceptance criteria will depend on the project that you create, but your project must fulfil the following requirements:

* Use a CSS framework other than Bootstrap.

* Be deployed to GitHub Pages.

* Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).



!! !! !! !! !! START HERE !! !! !! !! !!

Find the free data you will use and THEN build the site around what's available. Don't spend a lot of time coming up with an amazing idea only to find there is no free data available to build it with. Find two server-side APIs to use FIRST.
* Use at least two [server-side APIs](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/apis/api-resources).

* Must include one modal. It does not use native browser alert, confirm, or prompt functionality.

* Use client-side storage to store persistent data.

* Be responsive.

* Have a polished UI.

* Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).
AND HERE
* Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).

## Presentation Requirements

* Concept: What is your user story? What was your motivation for development?

* Process: What were the technologies used? How were tasks and roles broken down and assigned? What challenges did you encounter? What were your successes?

* Demo: Show your stuff!

* Directions for Future Development

* Links to the deployed application and the GitHub repository
